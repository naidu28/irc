state of affairs (IRC chat):

positive milestones:

- front end complete
- front end connecting to server.js locally
- server.js issuing a response
- gained understanding of client-server model and how internet file transfer works

current challenges:

- server response returns entire server.js script instead of printing a confirmation message
	(likelihood is that it is a problem caused by using xampp b/c it is designed for php, not js backend)
- as a result I decided to skip ahead to the step where I would host the current iteration of my website; difficulty in understanding how exactly web hosting via something like Heroku and Openshift works vs private domain
- Signed up w/ Openshift, Namecheap, and Heroku (previously)
- Confused as hell about which to use and how to use them
