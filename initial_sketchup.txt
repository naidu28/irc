Brainstorming:

> node.js
> lightweight - single paged
> I can host it on my portfolio website
> Intuitive



Ideals:

> Logic is handled server-side
> Design is simple and straightforward



Requirements:

> Saves prefernces via cookies or caching
> Login feature
> Server-side database connections
> Deployment logic is crisp and separate from back-end logic
> Useable in all modern browsers



Project Timeline:

> Night one (06/17/2015):
	- Write up wireframe
	- Begin looking at node.js modules that would help w/ setting up an IRC
	- Write some front-end for the page

> Night two (06/18/2015):
	- Write front-end scripts and create basic design
	- Highlight areas where server-side will need to interact with client-side

> Night three (06/19/2015):
	- Write basic server-side logic for one feature
	- Keep the logic for features distinct and in separate files (to test them individually)

> Night four (06/20/2015):
	- Integration

> Night five (06/21/2015):
	- Integration



Agile method: build most basic features first, then more difficult ones later



Features list (in order of decreasing priority):
